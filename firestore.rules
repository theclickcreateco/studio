/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for WhimsyTales App
 * @version Prototyping Mode - Data shape is not strictly validated.
 *
 * @description
 * This ruleset enforces a multi-layered security model:
 *   - **User Data**:  Strict path-based ownership for `/users/{userId}` and `/users/{userId}/bookmarks/{bookmarkId}` ensures users can only access their own data.
 *   - **Content (Stories/Pages)**: Stories and pages are publicly readable, but only authenticated users with admin privileges can create, update, or delete them.
 *   - **Admin Roles**:  Admin privileges are granted by the existence of a document in the `/roles_admin/{userId}` collection.  Rules use `exists()` instead of `get()` for Authorization Independence.
 *
 * @dataStructure
 *   - `/stories/{storyId}`: Stores story metadata. Publicly readable, admin-writeable.
 *   - `/stories/{storyId}/pages/{pageId}`: Stores individual pages within a story. Publicly readable, admin-writeable.
 *   - `/users/{userId}`: Stores user profile data.  Owner-only access.
 *   - `/users/{userId}/bookmarks/{bookmarkId}`: Stores user-specific bookmarks. Owner-only access.
 *   - `/roles_admin/{userId}`:  Indicates admin privileges.  Existence of document grants admin rights.
 *
 * @keySecurityDecisions
 *   - Stories and Pages are publicly readable to enable content discovery.
 *   - User data is strictly private, accessible only to the owning user.
 *   - Admin roles are managed via document existence in `/roles_admin/{userId}` to avoid costly `get()` calls.
 *   - User listing is disabled for privacy.
 *
 * @denormalizationForAuthorization
 *   - Admin status is determined by the existence of a document in `/roles_admin/{userId}`. This avoids having to store and manage a separate list of admin UIDs or use custom claims.
